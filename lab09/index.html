    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <a id="maincontent"></a>

    <main>
    <p> Currently, I am a dual major with Information Management and Technology and Advertising with a minor in Sociology. I am interested in the environment and different cultures and promoting a more sustainable and mindful lifestyle through the use of technology and advertising. Some accomplishment and skills of mine is I love field hockey and tennis and received the MVP award for my field hockey team in high school. Outside of work, I enjoy being outside, whether it be on the beach or taking my dogs for a walk on the river in my town. I also love yoga and when I am home, I try go as much as possible. Some unique personal history is my family is originally from South Africa and we go back every year to see them. I was also born in Sydney, Australia and have three citizenships: South African, Australian, and American.</p>
