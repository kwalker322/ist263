    <p>
        Some accomplishment and skills of mine is I love field hockey and tennis and received the MVP award for my field hockey team in high school. Outside of work, I enjoy being outside, whether it be on the beach or taking my dogs for a walk on the river in my town. I also love yoga and when I am home, I try go as much as possible.

<h2>Personal Information</h2>

    <p>
        I am from Great Falls, Virginia, which is just outside of Washington, D.C.. However, some unique personal history is my family is originally from South Africa and we go back every year to see them. I was also born in Sydney, Australia and have three citizenships: South African, Australian, and American.
