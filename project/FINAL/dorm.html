                    Finding kitchen appliances that are easy to use in the dorm is necessary to cook your favorite vegan recipes. Below, I have attached a variety of dorm-friendly appliances that are both my cooking holy-grails, and ones I wish I had.

                <p>
                    <img class="electricpan" src="../images/electricpan.jpg" alt="electricpan">
                    If there is only one thing you're going to purchase, it needs to be this electric pan. Easily found on Amazon, this electric pan can make almost anything from stir fry and soups to pancakes and grilled tofu. All you have to do is plug it into an outlet and you have a pan right in your dorm!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img class="kettle" src="../images/kettle.jpg" alt="kettle">
                    A kettle is a must-have in any kitchen...even if that means the floor of your dorm. Quickly boil some water for tea or your Top-Ramen noodles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img class="cuttingboard" src="../images/cuttingboard.jpg" alt="cuttingboard">
                    For the longest time, I did not have a cutting board in my dorm and was forced to use a paper towel or plate. After purchasing one, it made my life so much easier and helped lessen any mess I struggle to avoid!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img class="blender" src="../images/blender.jpg" alt="blender">
                    Starting my day with a healthy smoothie always calls for an amazing day. Frozen fruit and greens are easily found in any grocery store, and they don't go off! Just chuck any assortment of fruit or greens in the blender, and you have yourself an easy and healthy snack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img class="airfryers" src="../images/airfryers.jpg" alt="airfryers">
                    This is one appliance that I don't have and have always wanted. All you have to do is throw in some tofu or vegetables, and it's magically air fried! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img class="toasteroven" src="../images/toasteroven.jpg" alt="toasteroven">
                    I have a love-hate relationship with the toaster oven. This appliance can heat soup or leftovers, as well as make pizza and toast your bagels. However, I have started too many fires by putting plastic in it, so don't be like me and treat it as an actual oven!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img class="griddle" src="../images/griddle.jpg" alt="griddle">
                    This griddle can make pancakes and waffles for that all-American breakfast we've all been missing while away from home. Just plug in the girddle, pour in the batter, and youve got youself a delcious breakfast.
                </p>

                    <img class="kureig" src="../images/kureig.jpg" alt="kureig">
                    I love starting my day with a piping hot coffee. For those days you don't want to leave your room and spend money on a coffee, a Keurig is a must-have.
