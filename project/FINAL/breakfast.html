                <h3>Vegan Potato Hash</h3>
                    <img class="potatohashbfast" src="../images/potatohash.jpeg" alt=potatohashrecipe>
                    <p>
                        A delicious and filling breakfast that I love to make when I have leftover potatoes!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ingredients:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1.5 pounds of potatoes</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                        <li>1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
                        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>1 red onion, sliced</li>
                        <li>8 ounces extra-firm tofu, drained and pressed. (Trader Joes has pre-drained and pressed tofu that is perfect for college students)</li>
                        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
                        <li>1 large bundle of kale (I like to get the pre-washed and cut kale to use in my dorm)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Directions:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Cut the potatoes in half and toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil, paprika, cumin, and ½ teaspoon salt. Place on a baking sheet and roast for 25-30 minutes until crispy. 
                    </p>

                        While the potatoes are cooking, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the red onion and cook until softened (about 5 minutes). Crumble in the tofu, turmeric, making sure to break down the tofu into small pieces as you toss it until it's crispy and is darker in color (about 5 minutes). Add in the kale and cook another 2-3 minutes until kale is wilted.
                    <p>
                        When serving, add ½ avocado to each bowl and add any desired sauce. Enjoy!
